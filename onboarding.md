# Employee Onboarding

Welcome to the **Ever** company!  
We all are so excited to starting working with you! :rocket:

Please check information from this document, it will ensure more efficient and smooth communication and allow you to get started faster.
We try to summarize it all as a checklists of actional items, so you did not miss anything :)

## Work and Communication Management Software / Tools

- [ ] If you a full-time employee or full-time contractor, you should get an invite to your corporate email (@ever.co or @ever.tech domain) into your private email. Please accept invite and register.
- [ ] Make sure you enable 2FA authentication in all apps. We suggest you to do it right away in both private email and in your corporate email (if you get one).
- [ ] Make sure you set some avatar (any image, photo etc) in the corporate email.
- [x] If you register corporate email (@ever.co) all next invitations will be send to that corporate email.
- [ ] Please check your corporate email (if you have one) or your private email for an invite to the Slack and accept it.
- [x] After you get logged in into Slack, all next communications mostly will be done in Slack, not email.
- [ ] We recommend to download [Slack Desktop app](https://slack.com/intl/en-us/downloads) and install it on your PC. 
- [ ] Make sure you set the same avatar in Slack as you used for your corporate account (if you have one) or for other apps you will use. We need that to quickly see who send a message in channels. You can use any image as an avatar, not nessasary your photo. 
- [ ] You should also recieve invite to Time Management application, e.g. [Gauzy](https://github.com/ever-co/gauzy) or [HubStaff](https://hubstaff.com/). Please accept it, install app and make sure you start timer when you start work and stop timer when you finish your work (or get to a break longer than few minutes). Note: do NOT run timer when you are doing personal things (e.g Facebook or family calls). Only run timer when you work on company / clients related tasks. It's also important that you run Desktop based timer, not web based, because it will monitor activities / make screenshots and our customers will be able to review that information.
- [ ] Please make sure you set same avatar in time management app profile as you set in Slack.
- [ ] You should also receive invite to join our Github company account (for full-time employees / contractors) or get invite to specific repo (for part-time contractors). Please accept it.
- [ ] It's best if you can set same Avatar in your Github account, but not strictly required. You can also add your corporate email (if you have one) as secondary email to your Github account.
