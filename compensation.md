# Salary and Bonuses Information

We planning to have different base salary "stairs" in different regions for our full-time employees (not contractors).

As a rule, our full-time employees will recieve compensation depending on profession (e.g. software engineer or QA), experience (defined by "Level") and period working in our company,
see more information below.

In addition to the base salary (currently defined by individual employment contracts), all our employees who start working on our customers projects are entitled to receieving montly bonuses, depending on income, described in relevant section below

## Bulgaria R&D Salary Stairs for Software Engineers

We are planing to start introducing following base salary stairs somewhere in the middle of 2020 (and finish it till the end of 2020) for all our Bulgarian R&D full-time software engineers (with exceptions, see info below).

| Level  | Work Period | Gross Salary | Raise |
|---|---|---|---|
| Level A | 0 - 6 month | 1220 Gross | +0 (1220 = 2*610) | 
| Level B | 6 month - 12 month | 1420 Gross | +200 |
| Level C | 1 year - 2 years | 1820 Gross | +400 |
| Level D | 2 years - 3 years | 2420 Gross | +600 | 
| Level E | 3 years - 4 years | 3420 Gross | +1000 | 
| Level F | 4 years - 5 years | 5020 Gross | +1600 |
| Level G | 5 years - 6 years | 7620 Gross | +2600 | 
| Level H | 6 years - 7 years | 11820 Gross | +4200 |

Note1: We define Level A salary as official Bulgarian minimum Salary * 2 (currently it’s 610 leva, Gross). That way if the official minimum salary got reindexed, we also automatically raise everything yearly.

Note2: it’s the same idea as in Fibonacci numbers used above: 
200, 400 (200+200), 600 (200+400), 1000 (400+600), 1600 (600+1000), 2600 (1000+1600), 4200 (1600+2600), ...

IMPORTANT: salary raised according to LEVEL, not according to years! We measure years of work at the company, but only employee performance and skills define the level, not the number of work years in the company. So amounts of years given for demonstration purposes only!!! It’s possible some engineers progress faster than others and move levels faster (according to performance reviews we will do in the future) and it’s possible some engineers progress slower than others and stay at the same level for multiple years (or indefinitely). We later will describe formally each level minimum requirements, but for now, it’s at manager discretion. Other companies are using positions for that like Junior, Senior, Senior II, Staff, Lead, etc. For now, we will just use single letter Levels and call everyone who works less than 6 months Junior.

IMPORTANT: new employees with some pre-existed experience might be hired into any Level, not necessarily into level A.

## Bulgaria R&D Bonuses for Software Engineers

All our full-time employees, who work on customers projects are entitled to receive 10% bonus from gross income our company recieved from customers / partners from the work done by employee on monthly bases.

For example, if Employee A worked in Feb 2020 on some customer project and customer paid 3K USD for work done by Employee A to our company, such employee will recieve 300$ bonus for work over that month (paid to employee by our company during next month, i.e. in March 2020)

Note: we are building [**Gauzy**](https://github.com/ever-co/gauzy) project to switch Bonuses from Income based to Profit bases as soon as possible.
