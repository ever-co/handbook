# Compensation and Bonuses Information

We have different base salary "stairs" in different regions for our full-time employees (not contractors).

As a rule, our full-time employees will recieve compensation depending on profession (e.g. software engineer or QA), experience (defined by "Level") and period working in our company, see more information below.

In addition to the base salary (defined by individual employment contracts), all our employees who start working on our customers projects are entitled to receieving montly bonuses, depending on income, described in relevant section below.

## Bulgaria R&D Salary Stairs for Software Engineers

Please see base salary stairs for all our Bulgarian R&D full-time software engineers (with exceptions, see info below).

| Level  | Work Period | Gross Salary BGN | Raise | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Level 0 | 0 - 6 month during probation | 650 BGN | +0 | 
| Level A | 0 - 6 month | 1220 BGN Gross | +0 (1220 = 2*610) | 
| Level B | 6 month - 12 month | 1420 BGN Gross | +200 | 
| Level C | 1 year - 2 years | 1820 BGN Gross | +400 | 
| Level D | 2 years - 3 years | 2420 BGN Gross | +600 | 
| Level E | 3 years - 4 years | 3420 BGN Gross | +1000 | 
| Level F | 4 years - 5 years | 5020 BGN Gross | +1600 | 
| Level G | 5 years - 6 years | 7620 BGN Gross | +2600 | 
| Level H | 6 years - 7 years | 11820 BGN Gross | +4200 |

Notes: 

- Level 0 is for initial probation period (6 month) and paid Internship. Some employees who have already much of past work experience or can demonstrate extensive knowledge / skills will be hired into Leval A and skip Level 0.
- We define Level A salary as official Bulgarian minimum Salary * 2 (currently it’s 610 leva, Gross). That way if the official minimum salary got reindexed, we also automatically raise everything yearly.
- it’s the same idea as in Fibonacci numbers used above: 
200, 400 (200+200), 600 (200+400), 1000 (400+600), 1600 (600+1000), 2600 (1000+1600), 4200 (1600+2600), ...
- salary raised according to LEVEL, not according to years! We measure years of work at the company, but only employee performance and skills define the level, not the number of work years in the company. So amounts of years given for demonstration purposes only!!! It’s possible some engineers progress faster than others and move levels faster (according to performance reviews we will do in the future) and it’s possible some engineers progress slower than others and stay at the same level for multiple years (or indefinitely). We later will describe formally each level minimum requirements, but for now, it’s at manager discretion. Other companies are using positions for that like Junior, Senior, Senior II, Staff, Lead, etc. For now, we will just use single letter Levels and call everyone who works less than 6 months Junior.
- new employees with some pre-existed experience might be hired into any Level, not necessarily into level A.

**IMPORTANT: While we do have salary stairs as a reference of our employees monthly compensation base, exact amount of salary legally bind to individual employment contracts. Please use amounts above for information purposes only, not as legal bind values.**

## Income Based Bonus for our selected Employees and selected Contractors.

Most of our full-time employees (usually after probation period) and selected contractors, who work on customers projects are entitled to receive bonuses from income our company recieved from customers / partners from the work done by employee / contractor on monthly bases, as long as such income exceeds expenses our company have in regards to employment / work of the employee / contractor.

It's a 10% bonus from NET Income value our company recieved to bank account from customers / partners from the work done by employee or contractor on monthly bases.

For example, if Employee A worked in Feb 2020 on some customer project and customer paid $3,000.00 USD for work done by Employee A to our company (that amount is NET amount which gets into company bank account, i.e. all possible bank and other fees are already deducted), such employee will recieve $300.00 GROSS bonus for work over that month (paid to employee by our company during next month, i.e. in March 2020). In order to calculate NET bonus value, it's required to deduct all taxes paid by company (employer) on salary (bonus) paid to employees. In Bulgaria, it's easy to use <https://kik-info.com/trz/zaplata.php> to calculate approx NET amount from GROSS amount.

## Profit Based Compensation for selected Contractors

It's a 75% compensation from NET Income value our company recieved to bank account from our customers / partners from the work done by contractor on monthly bases minus all expenses related to the work of given contractor (including, but not limited to: base salary if exists, taxes, office space required for contractor to work, insurance costs, additional benefits costs, fees from bank transactions, software used in connection to work, and so on). In short - it's a 75% from "NET Profit" that company makes out of work by given contractor. 

For example, consider Contractor C, who worked in Feb 2020 on some customer project and customer paid $3,000.00 USD for work done by Contractor C to our company (that amount is NET amount which gets into company bank account, i.e. all possible bank and other fees are already deducted). Let's assume Contractor C used Visual Studio Professional license which cost 50$ per month, used internet connection provided by our company which cost 30$ per month and used shared office space provided by our company for his work which cost $100 per month. In such case, total expenses which our company paid for work of given Contractor are: $180.00 USD. 

So, in our example above, the Profit value is: $3,000.00 USD - $180.00 USD = $2,820.00 USD.
The contractor entitled to recieve 75% from $2,820.00 = $2,115.00 USD.
Our company entitled to keep 25% from that $2,820.00 = $705.00 USD.

Of course, it's responsibility of Contractor to pay all required taxes from compensation recieved (or they will be deducated from compensation amount and paid by our company according to civil contracts), same as it's our company responsibility to pay relevant taxes from our company profits.

## Notes on Bonuses and Compensations

- for each Employee / Contractor only one of specific theme ("Income Based Bonus" or "Profit Based Compensation") can be applied at company discretion according to employment / work contract conditions, base salary, amount of income generated by employee / contractor, employee skills, work hours and many other details. It means that Employee A and Contractor B can be granted with **Income Based Bonus** described above, while Contractor C can be granded with **Profit Based Compensation** described above, while Employee D may not be granted any bonuses and Contractor E may not be granted any bonuses or profit based compensations.

- we are building [**Gauzy**](https://github.com/ever-co/gauzy) project to calculate bonuses and compensations from Income (both Income Based Bonuses and Profits Based Compensation). Meanwhile we calculating both types of bonuses and compensations manually for each employee / contractor individually.
