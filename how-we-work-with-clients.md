# How we work

## Updates

* Unless our client/project requires more frequent updates (e.g. hourly), as a standard, all our employees should provide daily updates about the progress.
* If the project follows Scrum, it's best, of course, to make it over a daily standup meeting.
* If the project did not follow Scrum, we found that it's best to provide 2 updates to the client per day: one when an employee starts work and notifies the client about the plan to work on specific tasks/features and a second notification right before employee finish work, about progress on tasks/features done during the workday.
* Every update should include videos and/or screenshots about features that were built (if it's appropriate of course) to get early feedback and reference tasks numbers (e.g. task URL in JIRA or Github issue # / URL, etc., of course, if the project uses some sort of tasks management tool)
* If an employee is going to take a day off, itâ€™s mandatory to notify the client in advance.

## Time Tracking 

* All our employees/contractors are using Time Tracking tools (e.g. http://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy, Upwork Timer, HubStaff timer, or some other timer software client prefer to use for a particular project)
* Nobody controls the time of day when our employees/contractors work - they are free to set their own schedule as long as it allows them to do one short daily meeting (only if required by client project)
