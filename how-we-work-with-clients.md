# How we work with clients

## Client Updates

* Unless our client requires more frequent updates (e.g. hourly), as a standard, all our employees should provide daily updates about the progress.
* If the project follows Scrum, it's best, of course, to make it over daily standup meeting.
* If the project did not follow Scrum, we found that it's best to provide 2 updates to the client per day: one when an employee starts work and notify the client about the plan to work on specific tasks/features and second notification right before employee finish work, about progress on tasks/features done during the workday.
* Every update should include videos and/or screenshots about features that were built (if it's appropriate of course) to get early feedback and reference tasks numbers (e.g. task URL in JIRA or Github issue # / URL, etc., of course, if the project uses some sort of tasks management tool)
* If an employee is going to take a day off, itâ€™s mandatory to notify the client in advance.
