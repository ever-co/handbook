### General Rules

General rules for all contractors:
- Do not compete aggrement
- Do not entice away customers aggrement
```
The Contractor shall not for a period of 12 months after termination of the Contract seek to entice away
from the Company or otherwise solicit or interfere with the relationship between the Company and any person, 
firm or company who was a supplier of or an introducer of business to the Company and with whom the Contractor
had personal contract in connection with his work under the contract agreement during the period of 12 months 
prior to the termination of the contract agreement.
```

## Payments

We have in use multiple possible ways to pay our contractors:
- PayPal or Direct bank transfer, if contractor represented by some company and can issue invoices
- We recommend Rimuut + TransferWise, if contractor does not have own company, see more details below

### Rimuut + TransferWise

Contractor can register in the [Rimuut.com](https://rimuut.com) and in the [TransferWise](https://transferwise.com) and connect them together.

So the flow of payment will be: 
Our Company -> Rimuut -> TransferWise -> Contractor Bank Account or Credit Card

In the TransferWise, Contractor will need to setup Personal account (unless there is some registered business of course) and will need to deposit 20 Euro to open Euro virtual IBAN, which will need to be entered into Rimuut. Note, that Rimuut / TransferWise may require some additional documents from Contractor to confirm identity.

Note: it is possible to connect other services to Rimuut instead of TransferWise. Totally up to Contractor to decide.
