# Benefits & Perks

Ever Employees working in different branches (registered in different countries) and some benefits don't make sense or don't work in specific countries.
However, we will try our best to provide comparable benefits and perks to all employees.

## Benefits

### Employee Liquidity Pool

If Ever company (Ever Co. LTD) is ever sold or part of an IPO, tenured employees will be eligible to receive a portion of 5% of the value of the company. That 5% would be divided into units, based on the number of employees we have at the time. People who were on contract for less than 1 year would receive 0 units, someone employed 1 year would receive 1 unit, and so on, until you're fully vested at 5 years for 5 units.

## Bulgaria R&D

#### Birthday Day Off

#### Ever Holiday Gift

Every year, at the end of December, Ever gives a thank-you gift to the employees, delivered into the office. 
If employee working remotely, it's his responsibility to take gift from the office during no longer than 1 month, otherwise it will be consumed by hungry colleagues ðŸ˜Š

### Home Office Set-up

Since we allow all our employees (and contractors) to work remotely, we want to make sure employee home office is comfortable and hardware meets our software requirements.

So, if employee missing some of required equipment (Workstation, Monitors, etc.) it will be provided for temporary (free) use for the duration of employment contract.

It is also possible to upgrade employee existed hardware at expense of the company if that makes logical sense to do (e.g. upgrade RAM or provide additional Monitor if employee has already one monitor at home office).

In addition, if employee expected to travel, our company will provide notebook for temporary (free) use for the duration of the contract, instead of workstation.

Note: equipment provided for temporary use should be returned on contract termination
