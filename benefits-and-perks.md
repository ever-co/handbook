# Benefits & Perks

Ever Employees working in different branches (registered in different countries) and some benefits don't make sense or don't work in specific countries.
However, we will try our best to provide comparable benefits and perks to all employees.

## Benefits

### Employee Liquidity Pool

If Ever company (Ever Co. LTD or Ever Technologies LTD or our other legal entity) is sold or part of an IPO, tenured employees will be eligible to receive a portion of 5% of the value of the company. That 5% would be divided into units, based on the number of employees we have at the time. People who were on contract for less than 1 year would receive 0 units, someone employed 1 year would receive 1 unit, and so on, until you're fully vested at 5 years for 5 units.

In addition to the above, some of our employees/contractors have a separate "Stock Issuance Agreement" signed, which distributes some % of our company equity to those who decided to get part of the compensation in shares.

## Bulgaria R&D

### Benefits

#### Health Insurance

Medical Insurance can be provided in Bulgaria via UNIQA (https://www.uniqa.bg). 
The company pays 100% of the premium for selected employees. 

After joining our company, the employee can be enrolled in the insurance with coverage starting on:
- the 1st of next month, if the employee signed a contract not later than the 15th of the current month
- the 1st of the month after the next, if the employee signed the contract after the 15th of the current month

### Perks

#### Birthday Day Off

Starting from 01.01.2020, all employees can take 1 fully paid day off on the official Birthday date or on any other day of the same week.

#### Ever Holiday Gift

Every year, at the end of December, Ever may provide a thank-you gift to the employees, delivered to the Ekont or Speedy office. 

### Home Office Set-up

Since we allow all our employees (and contractors) to work remotely, we want to make sure the employee's home office is comfortable and the hardware meets our software requirements.

So, if an employee missing some of the required equipment (Workstation, Monitors, etc.) it will be provided for temporary (free) use for the duration of the employment contract.

It is also possible to upgrade the employee's existing hardware at the expense of the company if that makes logical sense to do (e.g. upgrade RAM or provide additional Monitor if the employee has already one monitor at the home office).

In addition, if an employee is expected to travel, our company will provide a notebook for temporary (free) use for the duration of the contract, instead of the workstation.

Note: equipment provided for temporary use should be returned on contract termination
