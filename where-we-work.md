# Where We Work

We are a fully remote company, which means that we do not have an office!
All our employees/contractors are free to work from wherever they see fit, as long as the environment allows for productive work.

## From home

Ever Technologies employees work from home most of the time.  
More information about home office setup is available [here](https://github.com/ever-co/handbook/blob/master/benefits-and-perks.md#home-office-set-up).

## From a coworking space

Our employees can also work from co-working spaces and we offer a stipend towards a desk in such a place (refund the cost up to a reasonable amount.
