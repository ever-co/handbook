# Where We Work

## Offices

The Ever Technologies LTD HQ is in Sofia, Bulgaria, in the Vitosha neighborhood, near Studentski Grad.

We have 2 floors, one (lower) used by people who only recently joined our company (employees on probation period, interns, juniors),
and one (higher) used by our senior engineers.

We have desks space for all employees in our company, but most of people also work from home regularly.

Anyone from our employees and contractors is welcome to visit Sofia and work from the office at any time.

## From home

Most people at Ever Technologies work from home most of the time.  
More information about home office setup available [here](https://github.com/ever-co/handbook/blob/master/benefits-and-perks.md#home-office-set-up).

## From a coworking space

Our employees can also work from co-working spaces and we offer a stipend towards a desk in such a place.
